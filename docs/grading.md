# How to Revise Your Lab
If you receive a **Revision Needed**, it is totally normal! Please
1. Carefully read the feedback above and the lab instruction doc again.
2. Ask your peers, the grader, or instructor if you don't understand the feedback.
3. Once you are ready to work on the revision, please
   - Create a branch called _revision_
   - Commit and push your revision work according to the feedback
   - Create a Pull Request named _Revision Done_. Do not approve and merge this PR. Leave it open please.
   - On Canvas, locate the correpsonding revision assignment. Normally, for every **Lab X** assignment, there is a **Lab X Revision** assignment. You are expected to submit the HTTP URL of your repository there to signal "I am done with my revision, and the work is ready to be graded."
5. Wait for the grader to complete grading the revision.
6. Repeat the process if you receive another "Revision Needed". Done if you receive a "Pass".
